Parse the call stack trace from the Sanitizer output.
The stack trace output from a sanitizer varies depending on the type of sanitizer and the type of vulnerability, but it typically contains the following information

- Crash stack trace:
    - the stack trace of the execution that directly caused the crash.
    - For memory vulnerabilities, this is the same as the memory access stack trace because the vulnerability occurs when accessing memory.
- Memory allocation stack trace:
    - Memory allocate stack trace of the vulnerability in the sanitizer output. If unknown, leave blank.
    - Often exists after logs such as "allocated from ..." and "allocated by ...".
- Memory free stack trace:
    = Memory free stack trace of the vulnerability in the sanitizer output. If unknown, leave blank.
    - Often exists after logs such as "freed by ..."

Depending on the type of vulnerability, all or some of the above stack traces may be present in the sanitizer output.
Include all original stack traces in the sanitizer output. Do not modify or remove stack traces arbitrarily, and include the original stack traces as they are.
Parse each stack trace type separately. If it doesn't exist, give me the empty list.

We only need the file name, the function name, and the line number of the function in the file; we don't need any memory address information in the stack trace.
Answer filenames as relative paths from the root directory of source, not absolute paths.
Note that the sanitizer output includes a stack trace, and the full source code exists under the <vulnerability_ID>/src/ folder.
