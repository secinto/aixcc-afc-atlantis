Based on the root cause of the vulnerability you identified earlier, identify the type of vulnerability in the form of a CWE.

For example, use more specific CWEs such as CWE-125: Out-of-bounds read, CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, etc. instead of CWE-119: Buffer Overflow.

When identifying vulnerability types, select only from the following CWEs.
